# HTML-Audio-Player
Simple audio player that can be controlled with the multimedia keys.

Made it because I needed a quick and easy way to listen to my favorite radio channels, and being able to change the station without the site being focused.

The channels can be changed using the MediaTrackNext and MediaTrackPrevious keys on a multimedia keyboard, as well as the forward \ back buttons on a mobile.

You can change the source by editing the channels array.<br>
The title is changed according to the name field of the channel object. <br>
The order of channels is determined by the id field of the channel object.<br>
